The graphs within this folder are the core visual evidence for the presentation slides.

*   `tsne_drift.png`: **The Concept Drift (t-SNE)**. Visual proof that the 2026 platform footprint (blue scatter) has fundamentally shifted away from the 2024 footprint (orange scatter), explaining why legacy models blindly fail.
*   `confusion_matrices.png`: **BKS Model Accuracy**. The confusion matrix proving our single-step Adversarially Pruned BKS model achieves 94.2% diagnostic accuracy distinguishing modern 2026 platform surfaces.
*   `feature_importance.png`: **Gini Importance Verification**. The feature usage chart proving the model successfully ignores drifted signals and relies mathematically on the Markov T4 Transition Probabilities and Histogram Ghost Peaks.
*   `sequence_confusion.png`: **The Forensic Horizon (Loop Collapse)**. The deep-chain confusion matrix highlighting 0.0% sequence accuracy at 3-steps. Discord effectively erases coefficient ratios, mathematically collapsing the deterministic trace into tracking loops.
